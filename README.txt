LAB 11: Closing
1. This class allowed me to spread my wings as I started to soar into the skies of web programming. This class provided instruction on the finer points of programming that couldn't be found online, insight into skills that could be useful as we produce independent and commercial work, and practice implementing our skills on projects that could be displayed to future employers.
2. My favorite project was assignment 4, the Frogger game. While this assignment was definitely the most time consuming, it was fun to see my work take definite shape and become a game that I could enjoy playing. The project lastedlong enough that I felt confident working within the javascript canvas, even adding a couple of details for my own amusement beyond the guidelines of the assignment.
3. I am most proud of assignment 3, the geolocator. I had a lot of difficulty with the google maps API, but after struggling through it with many hours of unproductive research and work, I finally stumbled on the solution to my problems. The fact that I could actually complete this project was a great personal accomplishment.
4. I have learned how to use HTML5, CSS, Javascript, Mongo, Node.js, JSON and more. I have learned how to find assistance with my issues online and persevere through the ones that couldn't be easily fixed. I became a stronger programmer and a better person. And it was fun!
