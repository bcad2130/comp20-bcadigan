		<h1>Score Center Security Report</h1>
		<h3>By Brett Cadigan</h3>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>I have been hired to test an online high score board for security flaws. 
		This board takes in the title of the game, the user's name, the score, and the time of posting. 
		It can then dsipaly the top scores in sorted order or high scores according to a searched username.</p>
		<p>The long hours invested in games like Frogger necessitate a secure site, where scores will be preserved indefinitely. 
		My job is an important one, to root out pernicious holes in the code that a hacker could exploit. 
		My employer, Andre Mendelsohn, has spent a long time coding this and wants it to be ideal for his potential clients. 
		His boss, CEO Ming Chow is notorious for his focus on secure web sites as he has many enemies in the Chinese Underground Hacker's Society.</p>
		<h2>Methodology</h2>
		<p>To test the security of this site, I will first be using black box testing to run through the site without any knowledge of the source code. 
		I will attempt to break the site using common hacking techniques. 
		Once these have been expended, I will move on to white box testing in which I will look at his source code in detail. 
		I will use this information to probe his site for the weaknesses I may have passed over the first time.</p>
		<h2>Abstract of Findings</h2>
		<p>The problems in this site were related to who can access the data and how. 
		It is very important to keep access to your site restricted to only those who will be responsible with the data.
		Additionally, the way that data is given to a site must be closely monitored by the site or bad data could replace the good data.
		Finally, if not all the data that is needed is provided, the website displays that data with a NULL (empty) value instead. The website should check before it displays such false data.</p>
		
		<h2>Issues Found</h2>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Open Cross Origin Resource Sharing</strong></li>
			<ul>
				<li><em>Location: </em>web.js</li>
				<li><em>Severity: </em>Medium -- Any malicious website could access your site's data</li>
				<li><em>Description: </em>Under both app.post and app.get, the code allows for access from any source website with "res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*');". 
				This could let any site post data or access the data on the site due to the "*" indicating that any website can access.</li>
				<li><em>Resolution: </em>The website should have the specific game site from which the scores will be posted specified rather than the universal "*".</li>
			</ul>
			<li><strong>Multiple Scores, Usernames, Game Titles</strong></li>
			<ul>
				<li><em>Location: </em>web.js</li>
				<li><em>Severity: </em>Low -- Multiple scores might overwrite the intended score</li>
				<li><em>Description: </em>If multiple scores (or usernames or game titles) are inserted, only the most recent of the json document will enter the collection. 
				As such, the correct scores could be overwritten with false scores within the same post document.</li>
				<li><em>Resolution: </em>The website should sanitize such that only the first score/username/game title inserted should be considered acceptable. All others should be voided.</li>
			</ul>
			<li><strong>Null Data</strong></li>
			<ul>
				<li><em>Location: </em>web.js</li>
				<li><em>Severity: </em>Medium -- If the required variable has a null value, the code will not be able to properly sort or deal with it</li>
				<li><em>Description: </em>If a data document is inserted with less than the required points of data (Game title, username, and score) 
				then the website will still accept it, displaying a 'null' (or 'NaN' for score).</li>
				<li><em>Resolution: </em>The website should test to make sure that all the necessary data exists before accepting any entry. 
				If a bad entry is found, the website would request that the user reinsert the data or just not input this data into the collection.</li>
			</ul>
		</ol>
		<h2>Conclusion</h2>
		<p>This code is relatively secure. It successfully prevents payload script from being entered into the usersearch which prevents some of the largest security attacks. 
		But it needs to be more wary of the data that it accepts. It has a danger of accepting too little or too much data, both of which could corrupt the final display of data.
		Finally, as it stands the site can be accessed by malicious sites as the CORS will accept any site. 
		Overall, the site is looking good and should be pretty safe from Chinese underground hackers.</p>
