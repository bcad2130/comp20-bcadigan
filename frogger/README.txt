I have successfully implemented the basic rules. Frogger moves with the arrow keys, if he hits a car or water he dies. 
If he hits the upper border or a forg sitting on a lilypad, he dies. If he is sitting on a log or turtle when it moves off the edge, he dies. 
Ever time he moves forawrd to a new space with a new frog, he gets 10 pts. When he lands on a lilypad, he gets 50 pts. When he finishes a level he gets 1000 pts. 
The page loads causes the canvas to load successfully. The cars and logs and turtles all move at independent speeds.
Extra featuress have been implemented. 
-A timer counts down, when it runs out the frog dies. Getting to a lilypad before then gives you additional points based on time left.
-When Frogger dies, a skull that shrinks onto froggers death location appears.
-Level progression. When the level increases, the speed of all objects increases by one.

I worked with Evan Ferber on this assignment.

I worked for about 25 hours on this assignment.
