This assignment three is successfully implemented. The google map shows up with a display of the red line with custom icons and connecting polyline and clicking any of the stations gets the title and incoming trains, north and southbound. Carmen and Waldo appear on the map and the distance to them is calculated from the present location. The present location is geolocated and marked and the closest red line station distance is displayed. 

I worked with Evan Ferber on the first half of this assignment and asked Eliot Alter a question about geolocation.

I spent approximately 20 hours on this assignment.
