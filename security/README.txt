README.txt

This writing assignment covers the bounds of assignment six. I found three security flaws, which I discussed and suggested solutions for. I wrote a lay-style summary of these flaws and discussed how I found the flaws. I wrote a conclusion that summarizes my opinion of the site. The HTML format is successfully implemented.

I worked on this with Evan Ferber.

I spent about 3 hours on this assignment.
